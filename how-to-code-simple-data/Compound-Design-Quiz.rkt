#| PROBLEM:
 |
 | Design a World Program with Compound Data. You can be as creative as you like,
 | but keep it simple. Above all, follow the recipes! You must also stay within
 | the scope of the first part of the course. Do not use language features we have
 | not seen in the videos.
 |
 | If you need inspiration, you can choose to create a program that allows you to
 | click on a spot on the screen to create a flower, which then grows over time.
 | If you click again the first flower is replaced by a new one at the new
 | position.
 |
 | You should do all your design work in DrRacket. Following the step-by-step
 | recipe in DrRacket will help you be sure that you have a quality solution. |#
